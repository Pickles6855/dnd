The Sunken Lands is a swamp on the south end of the island. It is home to a tribe of bullywugs, who evolved from the ancient druids that once roamed the island.

## Passing Through
If the players stray off the main path while in the Sunken Lands, they will be captured by the bullywugs, who made an agreement with the residents of Green Dale and Oakenrule where they would allow passage through their swamp, as long as they stayed on the road. Any player that has a Passive Perception of 14 or higher will see the bullywugs approaching. If the players stray off the path, they will be met by 5 bullywugs and 2 giant frogs. The bullywugs are hostile to the players but will first try to catch them in the mouths of the giant frogs if unnoticed.

## The Bullywugâ€™s Settlement
The Bullywugs are the descendents of the [[Ancient People]]
If the players are captured, a successful DC 20 strength check is required to pry open the mouth of the giant frogs. The bullywugs will take the captured players to their leader.
