## Past Adventurer
Many people around Green Dale talk about a past adventurer coming through the area around 50 years ago. Some know that he was a member of the [Mercenary Group].

## The Wandering Stag Inn and Tavern

_Ornately carved wooden details decorate this tavern. It is by far the tidiest tavern you have ever been in, the back kitchen being spotless and no stains on the floor or table visible. A male gnome greets you from behind the bar as you enter._

**Tolen Isgrasebir**, a male gnome, runs and owns the tavern. He is very organized and tidy, and a skilled wood worker, having built the tavern with some help from his friends.

**Strange Wizard** If the players ask Tolen about the wizard living nearby, he provides simple but adequate directions.

**Hobgoblins** If the players ask Tolen about hobgoblins in the area, he says they occasionally are spotted on the outskirts of town but mostly stay away from civilization. Tolen has no idea where they might be hiding.

## The Church

This church is like the one in [[Oakenrule]] but smaller.
