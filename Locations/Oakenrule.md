## The Gilded Goat Inn & Tavern

**Gale Merdosk** is the owner and bartender of The Gilded Goat. His wife, Bridget Merdosk also helps out around the tavern. Gale is a tall, strong human, with a large beard and a deep gruff voice. Gale used to be an adventurer, but now he spends his days tending to his bar and talking to the citizens of Oakenrule. He was born on the island but soon became interested in the mystery surrounding it. When his mom became worried, she told him the story of the previous adventurer and he decided it was better if he settled down. Gale will drop hints of his previous adventuring days, and with enough persuasion will bring the players to his residence for them to question him. See The Merdosk’s Home for more information.

## Wendle’s General Store

**Lyle Wendle**, an energetic, middle-aged halfling tends to Oakenrule’s general store. Anything in the Equipment section of the Player’s Handbook is sold by Wendle. If asked about the previous adventurer, the ruins, or anything to do with the mystery of the island, Wendle says he prefers a more urban lifestyle, without any magic, monsters, or mysteries, the three m’s as he calls them.

## The Merdosk’s Home

This is a small home, seated next to the large Gilded Goat Inn & Tavern. It is home to **Gale Merdosk** and **Bridget Merdosk**.

**Previous Adventurer** If the players visit the tavern, Gale drops hints of his previous adventuring days, and with enough persuasion, brings the players to his home to talk. If this happens, Gale will also provide the players with a map of the island. You can give them the player handout when he does this.

_Gale leads you down a set of stairs into a small basement. Bookshelves and maps decorate the walls, and a large desk dominates the room. Countless notes and books are scattered among the room. After you have entered, Gale closes the door and turns to you. “I won’t be doing any more adventuring, but I’m not gonna let all this research go to waste. I will try to answer any of your questions, but this is a strange island, with a thick mystery surrounding it.”_

**What Gale Knows** When Gale was younger, he spent his days trying to unravel the mystery of the island. His mother soon became worried. She tried to dissuade him from doing this. She figured that there had to be a reason why the island was sealed off, and that it was better to just settle down and live a normal life. When she died a few months later, he decided to honor her and bought the inn that he now runs with his wife, Bridget.

- Gale knows everything in the Common Knowledge section of Oakenrule.
- The strange dead trees that populate the island used to be a hot commodity, but Gale isn’t sure why.
- There is a tribe of hobgoblins on the island, although they mostly remain in the shadows, preferring to send their more expendable cousins, the goblins, out on errands. They came to the island long ago to investigate the trees.
- There is a deranged wizard on the island who lives near Green Dale who might know some things about the island’s history. The residents of Green Dale will be able to provide information to the whereabouts of this wizard.
